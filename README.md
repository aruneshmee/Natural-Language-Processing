# Natural-Language-Processing

When we apply machine learning models to text and language, it is called Natural Language Processing.
There are many applications of NLP such as conversion of speech to text on smart phones. NLP can also be used to predict  if a review is good or bad. It can be used to make recommendations for books. NLP focusses on teaching machines to understand what is spoken and what is written.

The library used in this example is Natural Language Processing-NLTK.
Why NLTK?
NlTK breaks down the part of speech with the tag associated with each word.

I have taken the a large number of reviews (1000) from a restaurant. 
In the present example, I have used the a well known model called Bag of words. It is a model use to preprocess the texts  to classify before fitting in the algorithms on the data. What this model does is measures the presence of known words from its own vocabulary.


# Steps
1. Cleaning the text to apply the machine learning model.
2. Create the bag of model.
3. Apply the machine learning model the  bag of words.
